## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL with `pgvector` extension

### Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, see the **Setup** section below.

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mporterdunning/AgentMark0.git
cd AgentMark0

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries listed in the project configuration to ensure all necessary packages are available for the project to function correctly.

Additional Instructions:
- Double-check that all dependencies are successfully installed.
- If any library fails to install, check its documentation for compatibility issues or alternative installation steps.


### 4. Install Playwright Browsers

Playwright requires browser binaries for its web crawling functionalities. Ensure the appropriate browsers are installed to enable smooth crawling operations.

Additional Instructions:
- Verify the installation of browsers using Playwright's built-in commands.
- Keep your browsers updated to ensure compatibility with web crawling tasks.


### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to securely store sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials. Create a configuration file and populate it with the required information for the project.

Additional Instructions:
- Never share your `.env` file publicly or commit it to version control.
- Use placeholder values in `.env` for sharing the project with others.


### 6. Set Up PostgreSQL Database

Set up a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data for the project. Ensure the necessary extensions, such as `pgvector`, are enabled for advanced functionalities. Verify the database connection to confirm everything is working correctly.

Additional Instructions:
- Test the database connection by running a simple query or listing tables.
- Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss.

### 7. Set Up Scheduler and Logging

The scheduler handles periodic execution of tasks such as data collection and analysis. Ensure the logging system is configured to capture detailed information about job execution and errors for debugging purposes.

Additional Instructions:
- Set a reasonable interval for scheduled tasks to balance performance and timeliness.
- Rotate logs regularly to prevent the log file from growing too large.


### 8. Verify the Setup

Run a series of checks to ensure that all components are installed and configured correctly. This step ensures the project environment is ready for execution.

Additional Instructions:
- Document any issues encountered during verification for troubleshooting.
- Create a checklist to ensure no setup step is missed.

### 9. Run the Project

Execute the project by either running the workflow directly or starting the scheduler for automated task execution. Choose the option that fits your workflow requirements.

Additional Instructions:
- Monitor the logs during the first run to ensure everything works as expected.
- Pause the scheduler if you need to make changes or updates to the code.


### 10. Set Up Git (Optional)

If you plan to track changes or collaborate with others, configure Git for version control. This is especially useful for contributing to the project or maintaining your codebase.

Additional Instructions:
- Commit changes frequently with clear commit messages.
- Use Git branches to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.


### 11. Testing the Project

Run the test suite to verify that all project components work as expected. This includes ensuring that the tools, agents, and integrations function without errors.

Additional Instructions:
- Add more tests as you expand the project's functionality.
- Use a continuous integration (CI) tool to automate testing.


### 12. Additional Configuration

Fine-tune the project by adjusting parameters such as data collection intervals and risk thresholds. Implement retry logic for web crawling tasks to handle temporary failures gracefully.

Additional Instructions:
- Test any configuration changes on a development environment before applying them to production.
- Document any customizations made for future reference.


### 13. Troubleshooting

Refer to this section for guidance on resolving common issues such as missing dependencies, database connection errors, or scheduler conflicts. Use debug mode to gain additional insights into any errors encountered.

Additional Instructions:
- Check the project logs for detailed error messages.
- Consult the official documentation of tools and libraries used in the project for further assistance.
